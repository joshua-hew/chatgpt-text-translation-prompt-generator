# Overview

ChatGPT and GPT-4 are very good at translating texts from other languages to English. Unfortunately, you might come across token or rate limits when trying to translate large bodies of text. In those cases, you can use this tool to break up a single large text files into chunks that fit within ChatGPT's limits.

# How to Use this Tool  

1. Upload your text file (or copy and paste your text into the box).
2. Choose your token limit (GPT-4 using ChatGPt Plus has around 4000 tokens).
3. Click "Generate Prompts".
4. Open ChatGPT of GPT-4 in your web browser.
5. Copy and Paste the prompt into the chatbox.
6. Submit and receive your translated text.
