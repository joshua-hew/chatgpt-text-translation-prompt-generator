I can't think of anything. I just mindlessly roll the small bead in my left hand.

“Player Kim Suhyun.”

10 years. I've achieved what I've longed and dreamed of for that long time. However, it doesn't disappear. The sense of loss and the painfully aching heart that fills me now still torment me.

“Player Kim Suhyun. May I ask once again?”

A soft but beautiful voice taps my ear. Drawn to the sound, I slowly lift my head. As I raise my head, I see the ash-brick floor. Then, at about the time when I had taken in the space of about 30 square meters, my view gradually stopped rising.

The 'Summoning Room' that announces the start of everything and concludes everything. And in the center of the room on a rectangular altar, wings that radiate white light were faintly flickering. I focused my gaze on the 'angel' sitting on the altar, feeling empty.

“Will I reconfirm the request of player Kim Suhyun. Do you sincerely want to turn back the time of the Whole Plane?”

“Yes.”

I slowly nod my head, staring at the angel in front of me. The beautiful appearance that could be called the epitome of beauty, the smooth skin without a single flaw, the risky clothing that occasionally reveals the flesh underneath. Everything was looking only at me.

But no desire arises. The angel's beautiful posture, the loving gaze, none of them could shake my dead heart. I lost all emotions since 'that day'.

“It's impossible to comprehend. All the angels, including me, can't understand you.”

“No, you're wrong. I don't want your understanding. Seraph.”

The voice in my ears is so cold. The voice of the angel, the Seraph, was trembling thinly unlike usual. I don't remember ever seeing Seraph being swayed, except for today. So does that mean what I'm saying now is shocking.

Even though she seemed to be swayed for a moment, Seraph soon regained her expressionless look. And she calmly began to reprimand me with her polite voice.

“Player Kim Suhyun, you have completed all the tasks of the Whole Plane and are the first player to grasp the summit.”

“But.”

“There is no 'but'. You have obtained the Zero Code you longed for. You have the 'qualifications'. You can achieve anything you want within the 'qualifications'."

“Seraph. We've finished talking."

“Returning to Earth? Good. You can go back to Earth while maintaining your current abilities. Stay in the Whole Plane? That's good too. If you have the Zero Code, you can be a king ruling all continents, or even more than that."

I sighed because she didn't seem to stop and put my right hand on my hip. The hilt of the sword that comes into the palm of my hand feels familiar.

“Phew, it's been enough to be deceived by such flattery for 10 years. I'm tired now. Seraph? I won't say anything more. No matter what you say to me, I won't reconsider using the Zero Code."

I grab the hilt tightly and raise the magic along the circuit. Seraph, who read the energy blooming from my whole body, quickly closed her mouth. But it was only for a moment. Soon, her face looking at me was filled with sorrow. It seems she hasn't given up on persuading me yet.

“The right to the Zero Code is entirely to player Kim Suhyun. We do not have the authority to interfere with it. That's why it's more regrettable. It's absurd to use an item with such a great power to simply turn back time."

"……"

“I will confirm for the last time. Player Kim Suhyun, do you really want to repeat the painful 10 years?"

Seraph's tone was almost pleading now. Suddenly, an inexplicable laughter burst from within me. This was literally an unwarranted laughter.

I laughed silently for a while.

This place is not Earth. It's another world called 'Whole Plane' where life is far from ordinary that modern people enjoy.

I slowly close my eyes. And I start to go through what I've been through one by one.

The first time I entered the Whole Plane was 10 years ago, when I was still 22 and the future was bright. The last memory on Earth was nothing but the thought of happily returning home after finishing two years of military service.

I fell asleep on the train while returning home after reporting my discharge, and when I woke up, I was immediately summoned to this place, the 'Summoning Room'.
